Music recommender system
One of the most used machine learning algorithms is recommendation systems. A recommender (or recommendation) system  is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.

Which type of recommender can we have?

 types of recommender system built : 
Collaborative filters
 collaborative-based filters predict what a user like based on what other users, that are similar to that particular user, have liked.

Collaborative filters
Collaborative Filters work with an interaction matrix, also called rating matrix. The aim of this algorithm is to learn a function that can predict if a user will benefit from an item - meaning the user will likely buy, listen to, watch this item.

Among collaborative-based systems, we can encounter two types: user-item filtering and item-item filtering.

 algorithms that can be used   nearest-neighbor, clustering, and matrix factorization  are used.

K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is considered the standard method when it comes to both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches.

 In this project   k-nearest neighbour was used.
